This project, titled Bootstrap Practice Lab, is a responsive webpage designed to demonstrate various Bootstrap components and utilities, including a navigation bar, hero section, services section, portfolio/gallery, contact form, and footer. The objective of this lab is to apply Bootstrap concepts to create a clean, responsive, and structured webpage that effectively uses different Bootstrap elements. The requirements met in this project include setting up Bootstrap via CDN and using the viewport meta tag for responsiveness; implementing a responsive navigation bar with brand logo/text and links to different sections or pages ; creating a hero section with an image, heading, and subheading, centered with Bootstrapâ€™s container class ; displaying services in a responsive three-column grid with icons, titles, and descriptions ; arranging portfolio items in a responsive grid of Bootstrap cards; providing a contact form with fields for name, email, and message; and a footer with copyright information and optional social media icons . The structure includes a single HTML file (index.html) with the following sections: the Navbar, which enables navigation to different parts of the page; the Hero Section, which welcomes users with a featured image and introductory message; the Services Section, which lists available services in a grid format, each represented by an icon, title, and description; the Portfolio/Gallery Section, which displays portfolio items in a grid layout with images and brief descriptions; the Contact Form, allowing users to submit messages with fields for name, email, and message; and the Footer, which contains copyright information and optional social media links. This project uses HTML for structure, Bootstrap 5 for styling, layout, and responsiveness, and Bootstrap Icons for optional icons in the services and footer sections.
